<h2> English vocabulary assessments </h2> 
This <a href="https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/245615">Gorilla open materials repository</a> consists of two measures for assessing English 
word knowledge on web-based testing platforms. The VST requires participants to pick the best definition of a given word from a set of four options; 
the WordFAM requires participants to indicate their familiarity with a set of words using a 7-point response scale. Both assessments sample English words 
across a wide range of lexical frequencies.

<p>Web-based versions of the full paper-and-pencil assessments were validated by <a href="10.1515_lingvan-2022-0115-long.pdf">Drown et al. (2023)</a>, 
  who also developed two brief versions of each assessment, as described for each task below and in an additional manuscript (<a href="10.1515_lingvan-2022-0116-short.pdf">Drown et al. (2023)</a>). 
  Normative data and psychometric characteristics (e.g., split-half reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent validity) are provided in the preprints. 
  The <a href = "https://osf.io/pcsu6/">OSF repository</a> for this manuscript also provides trial-level data and analysis code for the validation testing. </p>

<h2> EEG Informational Video </h2> 
Check out this incredible video that the Research Assistants in the Spoken Language Processing Lab at UConn made! The knowledge, confidence, and skill of these RAs was invaluable during my dissertation data collection. I am so proud of all they've accomplished!
