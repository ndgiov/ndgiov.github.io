I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at the University of Connecticut, working in Dr. Rachel Theodore's <a href="https://slaplab.uconn.edu/">Spoken Language Processing Lab</a>. My research primarily focuses on the interaction between levels of processing during spoken language comprehension. How does context shape how we interpret speech? Why do some people rely more on lexical and semantic context than others? What listener traits support perceptual flexibility during speech perception? I take an individual differences approach to explore these questions via both behavioral methods and electrophysiology. 

On this website, you'll find a list of my <a href="/publications/">publications</a> (including links to PDFs and <a href="https://osf.io/62syw">OSF repositories</a> associated with each paper), as well as my full <a href="//cv/">CV</a>. Just for fun, you can check out my <a href="/birding/">birding</a> page to see a neat little Shiny app I made to track my favorite hobby!
