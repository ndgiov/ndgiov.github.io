<h2> English vocabulary assessments </h2> 
This <a href="https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/245615">Gorilla open materials repository</a> consists of two measures for assessing English 
word knowledge on web-based testing platforms. The VST requires participants to pick the best definition of a given word from a set of four options; 
the WordFAM requires participants to indicate their familiarity with a set of words using a 7-point response scale. Both assessments sample English words 
across a wide range of lexical frequencies.

<p>Web-based versions of the full paper-and-pencil assessments were validated by <a href="10.1515_lingvan-2022-0115-long.pdf">Drown et al. (2023)</a>, 
  who also developed two brief versions of each assessment, as described for each task below and in an additional manuscript (<a href="10.1515_lingvan-2022-0116-short.pdf">Drown et al. (2023)</a>). 
  Normative data and psychometric characteristics (e.g., split-half reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent validity) are provided in the preprints. 
  The <a href = "https://osf.io/pcsu6/">OSF repository</a> for this manuscript also provides trial-level data and analysis code for the validation testing. </p>
