<h2> English vocabulary assessments </h2>

<p>This <a href="https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/245615">Gorilla open materials</a> repository consists of two measures for assessing English 
word knowledge on web-based testing platforms. The VST requires participants to pick the best definition of a given word from a set of four options; 
the WordFAM requires participants to indicate their familiarity with a set of words using a 7-point response scale. Both assessments sample English words 
across a wide range of lexical frequencies.</p>

<p>Web-based versions of the full paper-and-pencil assessments were validated by <a href="/_publications/DrownETAL-Preprint.v1.pdf">Drown et al. (Under review)</a>, 
  who also developed two brief versions of each assessment, as described for each task below. Normative data and psychometric 
  characteristics (e.g., split-half reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent validity) are provided in the preprint. 
  The OSF repository for this manuscript (https://osf.io/pcsu6/) also provides trial-level data and analysis code for the validation testing. </p>
