I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at the University of Connecticut, working in Dr. Rachel Theodore's <a href="https://slaplab.uconn.edu/">Spoken Language Processing Lab</a>. My research primarily focuses on the interaction between levels of processing during spoken language comprehension. 

On this website, you'll find a list of my <a href="/pages/publications">publications</a> (including links to PDFs and <a href="https://osf.io/62syw">OSF repositories</a> associated with each paper), as well as my full <a href="/pages/cv">CV</a>. Just for fun, you can check out my <a href="/pages/birding">birding</a> page to see a neat little Shiny app I made to track my favorite hobby!
